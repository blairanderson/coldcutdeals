  - WATCH AND LEARN THE LIFE OF ANTS! - Ants are exceptional creatures and watching them develop and the way they work is very interesting and provides insights and even inspiration for some people!

  - THESE ANTS WILL LIVE IN BOTH SAND OR GEL HABITATS! - Whether your ant farm is the traditional sand one or the more modern gel doesn't matter; our ants dwell excellently in both these habitats and, if properly cared for, they can live 3-6 months!

  - PERFECT EDUCATIONAL GIFT IDEA! - Observing an ant colony offers a great deal of life lessons, which is why ant farms are often used in various science school projects. Hence, our ant vial will make an excellent gift for children and teenagers!

  - ANTS ARE READY TO GO TO WORK! - Our harvester ants are not lazy workers - they will immediately start digging as soon as you receive them and get them inside your, ideally average-sized, gel or sand ant farm!

  - LIVE ARRIVAL GUARANTEE! - If you have thoroughly checked your area temperature, according to the instructions cited in the product's description, we guarantee a live arrival of your ants!
