description_markdown: >-

  - Spend less time shredding versus a traditional shredder - just stack, shut and you're done; shred up to 130 sheets with automatic shredding and up to 6 sheets at a time during manual feed shredding

  - 7-gallon pull-out waste bin with bin full indicator; runs consecutively for 10 minutes on with 30 minutes off to ensure longevity of the motor; for best results with junk mail, manually feed into top of machine

  - Auto shreds documents, paper clips, staples. Credit cards must be manually inserted into rollers in auto feed chamber; ultra quiet (â‰¤60dB) to ensure minimal disruption in the office environment

  - Intelligent Auto+ Jam Clearance reverses and re-feeds stuck papers; Intelligent Self-Cleaning Cutters automatically remove shreds that cause build-up and lead to jams
