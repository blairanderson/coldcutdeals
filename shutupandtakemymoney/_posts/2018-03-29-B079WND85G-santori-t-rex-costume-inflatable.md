  Santori T-Rex Costume, Inflatable

    - IT MAKES YOU LOOK TALL!! - with the costume being 7.3 feet tall (or 220cm as they like to say in Europe) it can make us guys who are between 5 and 6.5 feet look like monsters!!

    - YOU WON'T SWEAT!! - that much... the inbuilt fan's main job is to ensure that the costume remains inflated but also has this convenient bonus that it delivers air circulation so you wont be too hot

    - MATERIAL - 100% polyester, hand wash

    - UNISEX - Apparently there is little knowlegde as to what the difference between the male and female T-Rex' looked like

    - WIDE FIT - For the cold days, to wear a jacket or hot clothes under the costume. A width of approximately 1.5 normal sized people (should be able to) fit inside
