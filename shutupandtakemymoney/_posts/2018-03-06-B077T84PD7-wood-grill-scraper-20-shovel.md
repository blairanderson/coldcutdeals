  Wood Grill Scraper (20" Shovel) - Perfect BBQ Accessory for Cleaning Any
  Grill, Made in USA by Great Scrape

    - HARDWOOD GRILL SCRAPERS - The Woody 20" Shovel has a longer reach to protect your hands and fingers while grilling. Use our wooden grill scraper shovel to clean off your barbeque grill when you're done cooking. Made with a comfort grip handle that is more narrow in the middle of the paddle, it easily reaches under warming trays and grill grates to more thoroughly clean after grilling.

    - ALL-NATURAL BBQ TOOLS - Great Scrape makes these amazing wood products from real, solid Red Oak and Beech hardwoods, coated with an all-natural, non-toxic, food safe mineral oil commonly used as butcher block oil. The Great Scrape grill accessories come pre-treated and ready for you to use. Don't let a messy, dirty grill keep you from enjoying your favorite grilled foods.

    - NO MORE WIRE BRISTLES - Our Woody products are a grilling necessity for both serious grillers and those who are just learning. Wire brushes have annoying bristles that get smashed down and can be too harsh for many grills and bbq tools. Woody grill scraper bristle free products are safer to use and sturdy enough to do the job well without damaging your grill or tools.

    - CUSTOM FIT TO YOUR GRILL - One extremely useful and unique features of the Woody Shovel is that you customize the wooden grill scraper to fit your grill perfectly. No messy, burnt food will remain after you clean your BBQ grill with our Woody bbq tools. Simply heat the grill to high heat and use slow, firm pressure to glide the paddle front to back on grates, keeping the grooves in the same place each time.

    - PERFECT FOR GIFTING - The Great Scrape's real wood grill scraper is perfect for the BBQ and smoke masters in your life. Even novice grillers will appreciate the sturdy, easy to use Woody Shovel for keeping their BBQ grills clean. No matter their experience level, they will keep it in their grill toolkit for many grilling seasons to come, because this scraper makes grill cleaning a breeze.
