  - ✓ SHOCKPROOF and SAFE - The rubber surrounded eyepieces are made specially to protect children's eyes. Our binoculars were carefully crafted to be handled by kids 4+ years old, withstanding drops or falls and absorbing shock, due to the sturdy rubber coating.

  - ✓ PREMIUM OPTICS - Roof prisms are in line inside the optical tubes, allowing binoculars to be made small and light. This is a great advantage for hikers and birders. Prisms made of BaK-4 are preferred over the standard BK-7 because they have a higher refractive index rendering clear sharp and colourful images.

  - ✓ EASY FOCUS - Designed for child frienly use, the CampOutDV kids binoculars can be folded to match eye to eye interpupilary distance, making them a perfect learning tool for a 4 years old as well as an 11 years old as well. 

  - ✓ EXCEPTIONAL VALUE - Our high quality binoculars set, complete with the adjustable breakaway neck strap, carrying pouch and cleaning cloth, is perfectly suited for rough indoor and outdoor play and built to last. On top of that, with this purchase you receive the "22 MOST COMMON BIRDS IN THE US" E-BOOK, completely free of charge. 

  - ✓ 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE - We're standing proud next to our product, which was build tough and designed to last for years. You now benefit a 30 day money back guarantee alongside the 2 years manufacturer warranty.
