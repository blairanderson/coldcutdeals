  - WATERPROOF & SWEATPROOF PROTECTION: IPX7 water proof rating means it can be immersed under water at a depth of 3 ft. (1m) for a period of 30 minutes. That also means it can protect against sweat for intense workouts, running long distances or in the sauna.

  - BUILT-IN MEMORY: The waterproof headset has 8GB of built-in SSD memory (flash) to be able to upload music or podcasts. This will allow you to listen to your favorite songs while swimming under water with the waterproof headphones. The ONLY supported media formats are APE, WMA, MP3, FLAC & WMV. All other formats are incompatible.

  - INTUITIVE PLAYBACK CONTROLS: Take control of your audio with the built-in playback controls. Effortlessly turn on and off your headphones. You can increase or decrease the volume from the headset. You can play and pause your music. You can also switch between MP3 mode to be able to play audio from the built-in memory, as well as communicate straight from the headset with the built-in microphone, allowing you to answer or hang up calls.
